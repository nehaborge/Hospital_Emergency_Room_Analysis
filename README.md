## Project Insights:

Balanced admissions: patients admitted, showing moderate hospitalization

On-time response:  efficiency in attending patients promptly

High satisfaction: average score reflects positive patient feedback

Top Age Groups: define age group by the most frequent ER visitors

Referral Gaps: A large number of patients  were not referred to any department, which may need administrative review


## Final Conclusion:
The ER department performs well overall, maintaining a high satisfaction rate with reasonable wait times.

On-time service delivery  is decent but can be further improved.

Referral tracking needs improvement since many patients were not assigned to specific departments.

Dashboard visuals make it easy for stakeholders to monitor and take informed actions in real time.
